    <p> Jim’s musical career started when he was five years old, learning to play “Lady of Spain” on the accordion. He says, “I was the original underachiever. I’d shake that thing and smile, but I was sort of a late bloomer.” He didn’t really take music too seriously until 1964, while he was attending Villanova College in Pennsylvania. There he formed various bands, doing fraternity parties and playing “anything that the people wanted to hear: blues, rock, acapella, railroad music…anything.” One of those bands was chosen for a foreign exchange tour of Africa and the Middle East. “We had a good time,” Jim recalls. “We just ate what the people ate, lived in the woods, and played our songs. Of course they didn’t speak English over there… but if you mean what you’re singing, people understand.”</p>
